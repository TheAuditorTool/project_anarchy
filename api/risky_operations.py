# 1. aud risk-score: A critical path with zero tests.
# 2. aud risk-score: Code in a security-critical file was recently modified (simulated).
# 3. aud risk-score: A function that is a clear single point of failure.
# 4. aud risk-score: Third-party code executed in a critical section.
# 5. aud suggest-fixes: Missing input sanitization.
