# Fake Errors: 5
# 1. framework_detector.py: Imports Django in a FastAPI project, creating a "Multiple competing frameworks" issue.
# 2. lint.py: A critical security feature (CSRF) is explicitly commented out.
# 3. workset.py: This file imports a non-existent module 'enterprise_license_validator'.
# 4. workset.py: This file is orphaned; no other file in the project imports it.
# 5. deps.py: Uses a local file path dependency, which is a security risk.
